# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am eager to bring passion and creative problem solving to this space and am interested in growing my own skills as well. My professional interests include computational linguistics applications for South African languages and I am currently involved in the development of the African Wordnet as well as a multilingual termbank focussing on linguistic terms for university students. It is important to me that we empower people by giving access to information in their own languages and build the lesser-resourced languages piece by piece in a truly South African way - with colour and flair.
