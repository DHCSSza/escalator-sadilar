In 2022 the DH OER Champions initiative was led by Prof Jako Olivier, previously <a href="https://education.nwu.ac.za/UNESCO-chair-OER" target="_blank">NWU UNESCO Chair on Multimodal Learning and Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). The purpose of the initiative is to stimulate activism and research around the use and/or creation of OER for the digital humanities (DH) at universities in South Africa.

Scholars from South African universities were invited to apply to participate in the initiative which launched in March 2022. The opportunity was available to researchers, lecturers, and postgraduate students interested to include new online resources to their teaching or adapt their resources to their students' specific contexts. The programme provides support and funding for creating or adapting open learning content as well as researching the process. 

A grant of R20 000 were made available to each successful application.
