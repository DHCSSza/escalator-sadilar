The DH OER Champions initiative is led by Prof Jako Olivier, <a href="https://education.nwu.ac.za/UNESCO-chair-OER" target="_blank">NWU UNESCO Chair on Multimodal Learning and Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). The purpose of the initiative is to stimulate activism and research around the use and/or creation of OER for the digital humanities (DH) at universities in South Africa.

Scholars from South African universities are invited to apply to participate in the initiative which will launch in 2022. This is an ideal opportunity for researchers, lecturers, and postgraduate students who are interested to include new online resources to their teaching or adapt their resources to their students' specific contexts to receive support and funding for creating or adapting open learning content as well as researching the process. 

A grant of R20 000 will be made available to each successful application.
