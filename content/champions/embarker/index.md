### What will you learn?

The Embarker track will offer a more tailored experience to participants accepted into the programme. Content will be focused specifically on researchers and students who are quite new to digital and computational practices in research. The track will run over several months and will include opportunity for mentorship, growth and networking.

### Is this track for you?

Researchers and students who have attended a [DH-IGNITE](https://dh-ignite.org) event and want to continue working with the ESCALATOR programme to bring opportunities to their institution may apply for this track.

Details will be released in April 2023.

A limited number of participants will be accepted.
