    name: Consider various research workflows
    description: There is a plethora of digital tools and practices we can employ in our research. We'll look at research from [101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/) to explore research tools across the research lifecycle - discovery, analysis, writing, publication, outreach, and assessment. We'll also look at research workflows to see which tools work well together.

    name: Review your existing workflows
    description: >
      Once we've taken a step back to look at various research workflows, we'll take a moment to review our own. Which tools and methodologies do we use? What is happening in our respective research fields? What is happening across the research lifecycle in our own work? What does other people in our community do?

    name: Identify & prioritise learning areas
    description: >
      The next step is to consider what we would like to change in our research workflows? What might have the largest impact in the short term - the next few weeks or months? What do we need to learn to complete a project that you're working on? What new skill or tool could be a stepping stone to the next thing?

    name: Become part of a learning community
    description: Throughout it all, we'll help to embed you in a community of womxn following  the same learning path. Although each of us will be following a personalised learning path, learning different tools and skills, each at our own pace, we'll be learning together. We will also introduce you to other online learning communities that could provide tool-or methodology-specific support.

    name: Create & implement your learning plan
    description: We will provide you with templates to help with designing a **SMART** plan for learning the new skill or tool you identified in the previous steps. We'll help you set goals, provide support throughout the planning and learning process, and celebrate your success. This eight-step process can be repeated to continue upskilling yourself now and in the future.

    description: >
      We know the womxn in our community have diverse needs based on career stage, research topic, personal situation, access to infrastructure and other resources to name only a few. We also know that everyone learns at their own pace. Some may take the rest of the year to learn their new skill/tool, others may set new goals every few weeks or months. We look forward to embarking on this learning journey with you!
