<p style="color:#d11f26;">**Join our 8-step programme to grow your digital/computational skills as a researcher or postgraduate student in humanities, social sciences, and related fields. <br>
<b>First event: 19 May 2022 @ 11:30 - 13:00</b>. <a href="https://bit.ly/empower-2022">Register now!</a>**

### WHO SHOULD JOIN?

All sessions are open to womxn currently involved in humanities or social sciences research or teaching at public universities or research councils in South Africa.

**No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required**.

We welcome all womxn interested to learn more!

### OUR 8-STEP PLAN



### HOW IT STARTED

We <a href="../empower2021"> kicked this track off during Women's Month 2021</a> with a series of talks by womxn involved in tech communities and womxn using various forms of digital and computational skills in their research and teaching.

All talks were recorded and are available on the [ESCALATOR EMPOWER YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAWb55M7X2CHsI5HWOFx9ysQrMlJHFolW).

Presentations and recordings can also be accessed via the blog post summarising the inaugural EMPOWER series. [Please read more...](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/08/2021-08-06-empower-track-launches/)

In March 2022 we hosted a community connection event where participants were invited to 

### PLANS FOR 2022

Thanks to the positive response from the community, we established a small [working group]({{< ref "/groups/champions_empower" >}})  to lead the design, development, and implementation of the second iteration of the EMPOWER track. The team had an initial brainstorming meeting to discuss ideas and the needs identified in the community.

Based on lived experiences of the working group members (as women in humanities/social sciences research environments in South Africa), the most significant need identified was described as follows:

> There are many opportunities to learn about digital and computational skills, resources, practices and methodologies in research through open educational resources, online training opportunities, hands-on workshops, webinars and talks. A learning environment is lacking where theory is introduced, and participants get a chance to apply the newly learned skill in their work through practice, collaboration, and connection.

In 2022 we will roll out a series of activities over seven months that will include:

- **March**: a launch event to (1) connect with the community, (2) introduce the new iterationâ€™s objectives and structure, (3) get feedback from the community;
- **April - September** (per month): one presentation on a topic (1 - 1.5 hours) followed by a collaborative, co-working and discussion session (1.5 hours) two weeks later - presentations will be recorded and can be watched asynchronously and co-working sessions will be optional to attend and could be replaced by discussion in the Slack workspace for example;
- **October**: a wrap-up session to get feedback from the community and discuss the next steps;
- asynchronous discussions on the Slack workspace;
- an optional mailing list to supplement discussions.

### WHAT WILL BE COVERED?

The working group will confirm programme content in March. The content will include foundational digital and computational skills for humanities and social sciences researchers.



### HOW TO GET INVOLVED

#### Register for launch event - 16 March 2022 @ 14:30 - 15:30

To join the launch event on 16 March 2022 @ 14:30 - 15:30 SAST, please register via the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/empower-track-2022-launch-event-tickets-287975902677).

#### Join the conversation on Slack

We have created a Slack workspace for the community. Slack is used in many online communities for asynchronous communication, knowledge sharing, brainstorming, general community building and networking. Please join our Slack Workspace to join the conversation, not only for the EMPOWER track, but for anything related to digital and computational skills in humanities and social sciences. We want to hear from you!

#### Stay informed via the mailing list

We will create a mailing list to supplement communication via Twitter, Slack, and the website. More information will be shared shortly.
