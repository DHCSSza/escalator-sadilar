In 2022 we ran a 8-step programme and developed templates that may assist with learning new tools/technologies/methodologies.

### WHAT ARE WE PLANNING FOR 2023

The 2022 programme is currently being converted to an open online course that will be freely accessible. Watch this space for news!

In the meantime, you can still access resources from previous events. 

- [2022](../empower2022)
- [2021](../empower2021)

In 2023 we will be partnering with other data science initiatives hosting events focused on equity, inclusion, and diversity to ensure women from humanities and social sciences are aware of opportunities and resources to grow their skills and networks.

### WHO SHOULD JOIN?

All sessions are open to women currently involved in humanities or social sciences research or teaching at public universities or research councils in South Africa interested in learning new digital/computational skills.

**No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required**.

We welcome all women interested to learn more!
