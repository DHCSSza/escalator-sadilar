### WHAT ARE WE PLANNING FOR 2024

In 2024 we will be partnering with other data science initiatives hosting events focused on equity, inclusion, and diversity to ensure women from humanities and social sciences are aware of opportunities and resources to grow their skills and networks

In the meantime, you can still access resources from previous events.

### WHO SHOULD JOIN?

All sessions are open to women currently involved in humanities or social sciences research or teaching at public universities or research councils in South Africa interested in learning new digital/computational skills.

**No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required**.

We welcome all women interested to learn more!
