Thanks to the positive response from the community, we established a small [working group]({{< ref "/groups/champions_empower" >}})  to lead the design, development, and implementation of the second iteration of the EMPOWER track. In February 2022 the team had an initial brainstorming meeting to discuss ideas and needs identified in the community. Subsequently, in March 2022, we ran an interactive community event where participants had the opportunity to share their own experiences and needs.

Based on lived experiences of the working group members (as women in humanities/social sciences research environments in South Africa) and our community members who participated in past events, the most significant need identified was described as follows:

> *There are many opportunities to learn about digital and computational skills, resources, practices and methodologies in research through open educational resources, online training opportunities, hands-on workshops, webinars and talks. A learning environment is lacking where theory is introduced, and participants get a chance to apply the newly learned skill in their work through practice, collaboration, and connection.*
