### WHAT

This track is currently under development. If you would like to contribute, act as mentor or expert, or point us to useful resources, please [get in touch](../../contact)!

### WHO

The Enabler track is focused on the needs of people working in support roles, for example within faculties, the library, eResearch offices, or research support offices. The main aim is to provide participants with useful guides and resources to help them grow the local community in digital humanities and computational social science at their institution.

If you are in a support role and want to learn fundamentals about digital scholarship, please take a look at the [Explorer](../explorer) or [Embarker](../embarker) tracks. You are also welcome to point your community to the other tracks. More information about all the tracks is available on the [Digital Champions Initiative landing page](../overview).

### SCHEDULE

Information about this track will be published here and on our other platforms when it becomes available.
