SADiLaR-Wikipedia-PanSALB (SWiP) is a collaborative initiative by the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org) (SADiLaR); the free encyclopedia ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)) and the [Pan South African Language Board](https://pansalb.org/) (PanSALB).

The project was officially launched on Wednesday, 20 September 2023 at UNISA (Main Campus - Muckleneuk), Pretoria. While the SWiP launch event shone a spotlight specifically on isiNdebele to encourage the Ndebele people to actively participate in contributing content to Wikipedia, __the SWiP project is aimed at promoting all of South Africa’s indigenous languages online__. It does so by __bringing together communities of indigenous language users__ and giving them the __skills to create and review content on Wikipedia__. In doing so, they collectively increase their respective languages’ digital footprint.
