  Language preservation is an endeavour that transcends generations. By contributing your language content to Wikipedia, you are not only honing your writing skills but actively contributing to the preservation of culture, histories, and identities. Unlock the writer within you and embark on a journey to preserve languages, one word at a time. Find your voice and preserve your language.

  The project is targeted at __aspiring authors__, __language practitioners__, __lecturers__, __students__, and the __language community of practice__ at large.
