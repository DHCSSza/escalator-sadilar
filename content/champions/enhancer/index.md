### WHAT

The Enhancer track will give participants an opportunity to hone their digital and computational and open science skills with application to a current or new research project. Participants will have an opportunity to work one-on-one or in small groups with a mentor to learn more advanced techniques, tools, or practices in Digital Humanities or Computational Social Sciences.

### WHO

Researchers, students, and support staff who are already familiar with concepts related to digital and computational research will be prioritised. Participants will have to show that they will get support for joining this track via their supervisors or departments. 


### ðŸ“¢ NEW MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITY LAUNCHING JUNE 2023!

In June 2023 we are launching a 16-week mentorship opportunity through collaboration with the [Open Seeds Mentorship and Training Programme](https://openlifesci.org)!

Do you have an idea for a new project that has elements of open science and digital or computational methodologies, but need a bit of mentorship and support to get it going?

### Python and R Study Groups

We started a [Python](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-06-python-study-group/) and [R for Humanities and Social Sciences Study Group](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-08-r-study-group/). 

__Please join us if you want to learn Python or R, enhance your own skills, work on a specific project or if you'd like to support others in their Python/R journey.__

We offer a __welcoming virtual space__ where you can __learn at your own pace__. We typically don't provide any instruction, but work with individuals to get to a point where you can work through online open training materials such as tutorials and textbooks at your own pace, while being supported.

We meet __bi-weekly on a Wednesday at 11:00 - 13:00 SAST__. You're welcome to join as often as you want. No need to commit to participate in every session, join when you can!
