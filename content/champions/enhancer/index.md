### WHAT

The Enhancer track will give participants an opportunity to hone their digital and computational research skills with application to a current research project. Participants will have an opportunity to work one-on-one or in small groups with a mentor to learn more advanced techniques, tools, or practices in Digital Humanities or Computational Social Sciences.

The track is still under development, but we want to highlight other existing opportunities:
- [The Open Life Science Mentorship Programme](https://openlifesci.org/) (not only for life scientists but recently included projects related to Natural Language processing and other social science/humanities projects)
- [Deep Learning Indaba Mentorship Programme](https://deeplearningindaba.com/mentorship/)

### WHO

Researchers, students, and support staff who are already familiar with concepts related to digital and computational research will be prioritised. Participants will have to show that they will get support for joining this track via their supervisors or departments. 

### PRECURSOR: Python and R Study Groups

While we're setting up a more formalised mentorship programme, we would like to give our community opportunities to continue learning an growing. Therefore we started a [Python](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-06-python-study-group/) and [R for Humanities and Social Sciences Study Group](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-08-r-study-group/). 

__Please join us if you want to learn Python or R, enhance your own skills, work on a specific project or if you'd like to support others in their Python/R journey.__

We offer a __welcoming virtual space__ where you can __learn at your own pace__. We typically don't provide any instruction, but work with individuals to get to a point where you can work through online open training materials such as tutorials and textbooks at your own pace, while being supported.

We meet __bi-weekly on a Wednesday at 11:00 - 13:00 SAST__. You're welcome to join as often as you want. No need to commit to participate in every session, join when you can!

__[Registration form](https://forms.gle/EWvHp48pkVpk4i6i8)__ _(Please sign up to receive connection details and calendar invitations to upcoming meetups.)_

Chat to us and meet some peers on the [Slack workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) at the _#learning-python_ or _#learning-r_ channel
