### WHAT

The Enhancer track will give participants an opportunity to hone their digital and computational and open science skills with application to a current or new research project. Participants will have an opportunity to work one-on-one or in small groups with a mentor to learn more advanced techniques, tools, or practices in Digital Humanities or Computational Social Sciences.

### WHO

Researchers, students, and support staff who are already familiar with concepts related to digital and computational research will be prioritised. Participants will have to show that they will get support for joining this track via their supervisors or departments. 


### ðŸ“¢ NEW MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITY LAUNCHED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OPEN SEEDS!

This year we are collaborating with [Open Seeds](https://openlifesci.org/) who runs a 16-week mentorship programme focusing on open science and transdisciplinary collaboration!

Read more about our collaboration [here](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2023/08/15/OLS-joining-forces-with-communities-to-broaden-participation-in-open-science/).

We are excited to announce four projects from the ESCALATOR community will join the Open Seeds programme that kicked off in September. Watch this space to learn more!


### Python and R Study Groups

Our Python and R study group runs biweekly for 1 hour between 12:00 - 13:00 on a Wednesday.

__Please join us if you want to spend time working through Python or R tutorials or text books to  enhance your skills, work on a specific project or if you'd like to support others in their Python/R journey.__

We offer a __welcoming virtual space__ where you can __learn at your own pace__. We typically don't provide any instruction, but work with individuals to get to a point where you can work through online open training materials such as tutorials and textbooks at your own pace, while being supported.

You're welcome to join as often as you want. No need to commit to participate in every session, join when you can!
