### Is this track for you?

The EXPLORER track is open to anyone starting out with digital scholarship in Humanities or Social Sciences or related fields. There is no limit on the number of participants and anyone is welcome, but the focus will be on the South African context and we therefore specifically welcome those affiliated with universities or research organisations in South Africa.
__No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required__. We welcome anyone interested to learn more! 

### What will you learn?

A monthly virtual DH Colloquium where an invited guest or guests talk about their research projects that include digital/computational aspects. The monthly meetup includes time for Q&A with speaker(s).

The track also offers a range of curated [video play lists](#playlists) that explains some concepts related to digital and computational scholarship. For other useful resources, please take a look at our curated list of [training materials and courses](https://escalator.sadilar.org/global-training-resources/).
