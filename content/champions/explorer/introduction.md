### WHO

The EXPLORER track is open to anyone starting out with digital scholarship. There is no limit on the number of participants. 
__No previous experience with digital scholarship or computational research required__. We welcome anyone interested to learn more! We also invite those with more experience to join us and facilitate the monthly meetings. 

### WHAT

This track is a primer, offering a glimpse of what people can expect to encounter in the community and via other Digital Champions Initiative tracks. The track offers a range of curated video play lists and one scheduled contact session per month. The contact session is an informal meetup and discussion session open to anyone with questions or comments about the EXPLORER track, or the broader ESCALATOR programme. We can discuss anything related to the topics covered in the videos or other topics that might be useful to help people get started with their digital scholarship journey.
