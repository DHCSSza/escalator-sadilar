The ESCALATOR Digital Champions Initiative is a multi-track mentorship and networking programme that complements our other activities. The programme is open to researchers, professional staff, and students from the [26 public universities](https://www.usaf.ac.za/public-universities-in-south-africa/) and research councils in South Africa. Each track offers a unique learning opportunity to support community members' distinct needs and motivations. Tracks differ based on the target audience, expected learning outcomes, engagement strategies, number of participants that can be accommodated, committment expected from participants, and duration.

The Digital Champions Initiative will be rolled out in a phased approach to harness the strengths of our growing community optimally. For more detail on each track, click on the links below. We will also shortly share a side-by-side comparison of the different tracks.
