title: Connecting with the DH & CSS Community
subtitle: ESCALATOR is a programme that aims to bring together researchers, students, professional academic staff, librarians, IT, archivists, and others together around the shared interest in digital and computational aspects of humanities and social sciences research. The focus is specifically to help grow a community of practice in South Africa, but we also help to connect our community to regional and global initiatives.
