    DH-IGNITE is a regional event hosted by [SADiLaR](https://sadilar.org) as part of the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org). Through the event we aim to bring people together who are interested to learn more about Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Sciences (CSS) as well as those who are already active in these fields. 
    
    The programme is open to researchers, postgraduate student and professional academic staff affiliated with South African public universities and research institutes.

    - **5 DH-IGNITE** events to reach **all 26 public universities** across the country.
    - We'll be exploring **digital/computational methodologies** in humanities and social sciences!
