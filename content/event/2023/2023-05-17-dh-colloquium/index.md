    With the increasing adoption of Open Knowledge principles in research and the growing availability of born-digital and digital collections, as well as data-intensive methods, new questions arise on the best practices for open research in the humanities. Data Publication is acquiring increasing visibility and interest, also thanks to the growing popularity of data journals, publishing venues devoted to peer-reviewed publications describing datasets and crediting their creators (data papers). In this talk I will present my experience of leading the Journal of Open Humanities Data, a data journals dedicated to humanities research and its role in supporting the community of Open Humanities researchers.
