title: "Publishing data papers in the humanities: my experience from the Journal of Open Humanities Data"
event: Our presentation will report on the co-development process of an Open Education Resource (OER) in Open Distance Learning (ODL). OER have many benefits for higher education, such as expanding access, cutting costs, and improving the quality of teaching and learning. However, the question remains how OER can be developed sustainably to support both teaching and learning?

summary: 
abstract: |
    As educators of a structured master's in Education program specialising in ODL, we collaborated with our students to create an OER using our lecture notes and student assignments. Although we previously used OERs and open texts, they were not contextualised and mainly from developed contexts. We aimed to create a contextually relevant OER accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. By creating contextually relevant OER, we hope to make education accessible to learners from different backgrounds. Through this collaborative effort, we created an OER that not only aligned with the curriculum but also catered to the diverse needs of our learners. We believe that the use of OER has the potential to revolutionise the way education is delivered, making it more accessible, affordable, and equitable for all.
