summary: 
abstract: |
    There seems to be a surplus of trust and distrust in contemporary media culture. On the one hand, we place great trust in the platforms that govern and structure our online lives. We rely on algorithms to organize our lives and make decisions for us. We fall prey to confirmation bias and filter bubbles, which we might characterize as an overly trusting attitude towards (human and/or technological) others. On the other, increasing political, ideological, and epistemological polarization in culture means we can be deeply suspicious of others outside our ideological communities, and trust in experts is waning in certain communities. Radicalizing content and the mainstreaming of conspiracy thought only contribute to a deep-seated distrust of groups outside of their own community, and of things as they seem.

    During this presentation, Inge will look at the trust- part of this equation, through the lens of what Paul Ricoeur has called the ‘hermeneutics of faith’. He will also examine the role that trust plays in online discussions on the notorious case of the trial of Johnny Depp versus his ex-wife Amber Heard.
