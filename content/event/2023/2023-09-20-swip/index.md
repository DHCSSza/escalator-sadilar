> “The dislocation of our languages is perpetuated by not having pride to speak one’s own mother

> efforts to develop our language to be an equal to others.”

> These were the words of His Majesty iNgwenyama Makhosonke II, King of the Ndebele Kingdom, who 
> joined other dignitaries at the launch of a new collaborative initiative by the South African 
> Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR), Wikipedia, and Pan South African Language Board 
> (PanSALB), aimed at promoting indigenous South African languages on Wikipedia.
