    Join us for the DH Colloquium with Chao Tayiana Maina, where we'll dive into exciting discussions on new technologiesâ€”don't miss it!    
    
    Encounters with new technologies often bring opportunities to create new narratives, but they also bear the potential to entrench existing ones that have prioritized certain perspectives in place of others. 

    This presentation looks at the ways in which digital tools and platforms are currently being used within the museum sector across different African countries. What challenges do these platforms present and how do they allow practitioners to subvert entrenched ideologies? Most importantly, it looks at the implementation of these technologies and questions what is needed to successfully scale, implement and support a growing ecosystem of digital cultural practitioners in the region.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
