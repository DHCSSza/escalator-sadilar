    Join us as we look at Network Science & the DH: Applications, opportunities & challenges for interdisciplinary research in the SA context.
  
    Network science has opened up new avenues of research since its inception more than two decades ago, and also for the Humanities. As a data-driven and computer-based scientific approach, network science is not only interdisciplinary by nature, but also ties in with various fields in the Digital Humanities.

    With applications across all fields in the Humanities, its utility has been thoroughly demonstrated. In this talk, the speaker will discuss what network science is, its applications across the Humanities, and talk about some challenges and future prospects.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
