    This session offers an in-depth exploration of the transformation of Heinrich Bullinger's vast 12,000-letter corpus into a dynamic, fully digital, and multilingual format. We'll delve into the sophisticated digital workflows that navigate challenges such as code-switching, text normalisation, machine translation, and the automatic recognition of handwritten texts.
