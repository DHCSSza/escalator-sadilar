abstract: |
    Globally, multilingualism is the norm rather than the exception, and there is startling diversity in the linguistic and contextual factors that shape it. For several decades now, scholars have voiced concerns about sampling biases in multilingualism research and the threats that they pose to the generalizability of our knowledge in this domain. These concerns, however, have lacked empirical support.

    In this presentation, the speakers will discuss a recent project in which they set out to assess linguistic and geographic diversity in research on multilingualism published in high-impact journals.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
