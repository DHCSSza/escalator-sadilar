summary: 
abstract: |
    Over the years, it has been evident that language learners in South African schools struggle with reading at appropriate levels of comprehension and fluency. Despite numerous interventions to improve learners’ reading levels, the texts used in schools to teach and assess reading have received insufficient attention. This leaves the impact of the composition of the texts unexplored as the possible root for the lack of improvement in reading ability.

    Conversely, the approach outlined in this presentation addresses the readability of Sesotho texts by focusing on the texts and not the specific reader. The end goal of the project is the development of readability measures that can be used to assess the suitability of texts for different grade levels.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
