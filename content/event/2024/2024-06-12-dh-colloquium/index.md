    The talk will discuss a research project proposal aiming to create and evaluate the model of Universal Discourse: a unified, multilingual, corpus-based representation of text as a whole, going beyond the meaning of individual sentences to the level of inter-sentential semantic connections.

    This project aims to integrate and expand upon the ISO 24617-8 standard which outlines the representation of such relations. The model will be used to re-annotate a set of existing discourse corpora, previously annotated under varying representation standards.

    This approach aims to produce a harmonized dataset, which will be used for the implementation of several prototypes of discourse parsers intended to test the applicability of the model to computational processing.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
