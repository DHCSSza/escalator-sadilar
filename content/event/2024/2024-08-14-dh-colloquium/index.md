abstract: |
    Fifteen years of tracking down, researching and advocating for the world's minority scripts have shown me not only the astonishing variety and number of written forms in use (perhaps as many as 300), but that our standard definition and understanding of writing is badly askew.

    Mark your calendars and make sure to secure your spot for the SADilaR DH Colloquium. Stay tuned for further updates and details on how to join this exciting online event.
