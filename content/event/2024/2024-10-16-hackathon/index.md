## About the event
---

The hackathon will bring together an interdisciplinary Digital Humanities team in Eswatini from 16 to 18 October,  2024 to develop demos in the area of digital media studies while creating a collection of reusable, modular code for using various methods to study social media, online newspapers and mobile media. These demos should show the possibilities in this area and participants should make code available for reuse by digital media researchers in their own research projects. This initiative forms part of the Digital Humanities and Open Science movement in Southern Africa.
