 In May 2022 we kicked off by looking at the plethora of tools that are available to researchers across the research lifecycle. The introductory presentation featured [101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/) - a project that evaluated software and workflows used throughout the research lifecycle. Resources produced by the 101 Innovations team are available under open licences and can be re-used by community members in their learning and training.
