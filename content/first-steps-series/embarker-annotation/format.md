### Step 1: Join the virtual introduction session 💻

Participants will first attend an online (virtual) session where a general introduction and contextualization will be provided. They will also be introduced to a basic shared annotation task (using a simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, negating the need for training with specialized software) during this first session.

### Step 2: Submit an application for the in-person event ✅ 
 
Participants will then have to submit their annotations to be invited to an in-person event at your university where the results from the shared task will be used to further populate the African Wordnet. The resulting data from the shared task will not be evaluated in any way, but simply used to encourage real interest and show commitment. 

### Step 3: Attend a dedicated in-person training event 🧑🏽‍🎓  

The in-person event will be a full two-day session – one day devoted to introducing participants to the best practice in annotation and common tips and tricks that the African Wordnet team have learnt. The second day will be spent working with the results from the shared task, including populating the African Wordnet with some of the best examples.

### Step 4: Reflect and connect virtually 👥

Another opportunity for interaction will be created in a follow-up virtual event where participants will be invited to share their experience with the work, what they have learnt and how they envision using the skills in their own research. Those who are eager to continue with the annotation introduced in the shared task will also be invited to co-author a research publication, outlining our approach to eliciting additional annotation and thereby enhancing the African Wordnet.
