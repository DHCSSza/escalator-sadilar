The Department of African Languages at Unisa hosts the development of the African Wordnet and Multilingual Linguistic and Literary Termbank. The project is funded and supported by the South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR) and you can read the full project description here. All the official written languages of South Africa form part of this project, with a first version of the African Wordnet for South African Sign Language being explored in the latest development phase. 

In line with our aims for the current development phase, we would like to strengthen the broader Digital Humanities community by offering skills development workshops centered around the resources developed and lessons learnt in the above-mentioned project. This opportunity will consist of:
- a virtual introductory session, including introduction to a shared task to get participants involved, 
- an in-person workshop over two days to further advance the skills learnt in the virtual session, and
- a virtual follow-up session to ensure that participants are ready to use the skills learnt and grow from there.
