The Department of African Languages at Unisa hosts the development of the African Wordnet and Multilingual Linguistic and Literary Termbank.

The Department of African Languages at Unisa hosts the development of the African Wordnet and Multilingual Linguistic and Literary Termbank. The project is funded and supported by the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org) (SADiLaR) and you can read the full project description [here](https://sadilar.org/en/african-wordnet-and-linguistic-terminology/). All 9 of the indigenous South African languages offered in the Department at Unisa form part of this project, with first versions of the African Wordnet for Afrikaans and South African Sign Language being explored in the latest development phase. South African English acts as pivot language to create multilingual, South African resources.

In line with our aims for the current development phase, we would like to strengthen the broader Digital Humanities community by offering skills development workshops centered around the resources developed and lessons learnt in the above-mentioned project. This opportunity will consist of:
- a virtual introductory session
- a shared task to get participants involved 
- and an in-person workshop over two days to further advance the skills learnt in the virtual session.
