To ensure the community have an opportunity to provide direct input and co-design the programme, working groups will be established that are directly linked to programme deliverables. Initially these working groups will focus on:
- developing various tracks for the champions programme e.g. the [EMPOWER track 2022](../champions_empower)
- [monitoring and evaluation of the ESCALATOR programme](../monitor)
- [mapping the landscape of stakeholders and training initiatives](../stakeholder-map-wg) for digital humanities and computational social science in South Africa.

Please join these working groups if you are keen to co-design various elements of the programme.

You are also welcome to suggest and establish new working groups based on gaps and opportunities identified.

For more information about the working groups, if you'd like to join an existing group, or if you want to suggest and/or an establish a new group, please email [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za).
