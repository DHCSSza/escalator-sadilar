title: "Working group: Monitoring & Evaluation"
subtitle: "Setting up the project to measure impact"

---

The working group will be responsible for tracking and measuring the impact of activities and resources developed by ESCALATOR.

We will use best practices related to monitoring and evaluation including:
- the development of a Theory of Change to communicate the expected impact and causal pathways showing how activities and outputs will lead to the impact
- a logical framework for measuring progress and ensuring we collect the right data to allow monitoring and evaluation to take place
- identifying indicators and targets early on and re-evaluating as the programme progresses
- stakeholder communication throughout the programme
- regular meetings to reflect on progress, challenges, and opportunities as well as the changing landscape of education specifically related to COVID-19.

If you have monitoring and evaluation experience, please join us?
