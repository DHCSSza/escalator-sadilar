Humanities and Social Sciences research and education are in dire need of strong
coordinated interventions to enable the pervasive adoption of digital research
methodologies and practices. Over the past few years several capacity
development initiatives were implemented within various institutions and
communities, but South Africa still lacks a national, integrated active community
of practice in this space.

In order to bring large scale adoption of digital research methodologies and
practices to the Social Sciences and Humanities the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org) (SADiLaR)
established the ESCALATOR project. SADiLaR is a national centre supported by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) as part of the [South African Research Infrastructure Roadmap](https://www.dst.gov.za/images/Attachments/Department_of_Science_and_Technology_SARIR_2016.pdf) (SARIR). ESCALATOR will consist of a national digital champions program in combination with an orchestrated capacity development and awareness raising initiative.

Ad hoc activities have the tendency to create excitement
and interest, but leaves participants neglected, disempowered, and disappointed
as they often lack the social and research networks and skill to make use of
opportunities and resources that were taught or discussed. With every new
intervention, it seems as if community have to be built from scratch if an ad hoc
capacity development approach is followed.

The proposed program will ensure the
sustainability of the community by contributing to the development of leaders at the public universities and research centres.
Through the interventions, both champions and other community members will
build skills and confidence in using digital tools and methodologies in their own
research and teaching.
The program will align closely with other institutional, regional, national and
international digital capacity and community development as well as infrastructure
initiatives.
