  label: "ESCALATOR offers a range of activities and resources. To help you make the most of the programme, we offer a weekly on-boarding session where you can meet the programme team, get connected to the Slack workspace, and learn about opportunities relevant to your current needs. We also want to hear how we can improve the programme and what we should include. Therefore we've designed a short needs assessment survey. Please complete it, or reach out to us to discuss."
