## Project description
---

We plan to do a needs analysis on relevant topics to include in the OER. Based on previous feedback from students (from a related question in their last assessment) we will determine topics in the field of ODeL that need to be addressed in solving the problems we indicated above. Secondly, based on our institution's policies, we will seek permission and ethical clearance before inviting our students to be part of this envisaged project. Thirdly, once we know who is interested to be part of the project, we will do a contents page, share responsibilities and start writing. We will adhere to provided timelines.
