In this post we share some links to recent blog posts and news articles that may be of interest to our community. We’ll be posting a community round-up every month, so please be sure to [let us know](https://escalator.sadilar.org/contact/) if you’d like to contribute news to this post or write your own post on the ESCALATOR website.

### SADiLaR newsletter published

The [second SADiLaR newsletter](https://www.sadilar.org/index.php/en/10-news/283-newsletter-jun-2021) was published in June 2021. The highlight is that the document is available in all 11 South African languages! 

### New book available

Reframing Digital Humanities: Conversations with Digital Humanists is an open educational resource that was published earlier in 2021. Read more about this open, free, online book by Prof Julian Chambliss from Michigan State University in [his recent blog post](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/jchambliss/2021/06/07/reframing-digital-humanities-conversations-digital-humanists) or [access the book here](https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/reframingdh).

### Regular training blog posts

The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities, Europe (DARIAH-EU) has a regular blog feature called [#TrainingTuesday](https://www.dariah.eu/2020/01/14/dariah-eu-launches-trainingtuesday-campaign/). In May and June the campaign featured the following posts:

- [Setting up a CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model](https://www.dariah.eu/2021/06/01/trainingtuesday-setting-up-a-cidoc-crm/) for semantic data relating to cultural heritage
- [Game.Play.Design in the Arts and Humanities](https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/25/trainingtuesday-game-play-design-in-the-arts-and-humanities/)
- Two posts discussing the practicalities and potential pitfalls of managing data during and after a research project available [here](https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/18/trainingtuesday-an-ontologist-and-a-data-scientist-walk-into-a-bar-data-in-research-projects/) and [here](https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/04/trainingtuesday-an-ontologist-and-a-data-scientist-walk-into-a-bar-managing-data-during-and-after-projects/) 
- [Open data for humanists - a pragmatic guide](https://www.dariah.eu/2021/05/11/trainingtuesday-open-data-for-humanists-a-pragmatic-guide/)

### A collection of posts from Day of Digital Humanities 2021

King’s College London’s Department of Digital Humanities [compiled a number of blog posts](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/ddh/2021/06/10/day-of-digital-humanities-2021/) for the annual [Day of Digital Humanities](https://dhcenternet.org/initiatives/day-of-dh/2021) that took place on 29 April this year. The theme for 2021 was “Multilingual DH”.

### Digital Humanities Special Issue on AudioVisual Data in DH

> [The] special issue explores audio and visual (AV) data as form, method, and practice in the digital humanities. Spurred by recent advances in computing alongside disciplinary expansions of what counts as evidence, audio and visual ways of knowing are enjoying a more prominent place in the field. Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars are building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know, and why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire field of DH.

For a detailed list of contributions, which can all be read for free online, please visit the [DHQ website](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/preview/index.html).


### Summer Institute in Computational Social Sciences coming to Stellenbosch

In June/July this year, the Department of Information Science at Stellenbosch University  will be hosting the virtual [Summer Institute in Computational Science](https://sicss.io/2021/stellenbosch/). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together Masters and Doctoral students interested in computational social science. The event is open to both social scientists and data scientists. Although the application deadline has already passed, we wanted to create awareness of the event.

### Early bird registration still open for the 7th International Conference on Computational Social Science

Register by 21 June to get access to the early bird registration fee for [IC2S2 2021](https://ic2s2-2021.ethz.ch/). Also note that conference registration includes a [#datathon event](https://ic2s2-2021.ethz.ch/datathon/) focusing on data related to the COVID pandemic.

### Other channels for sharing news

I'm sure there's much more to talk about and share, please tell the community via our Twitter account [@DHCSSza](https://twitter.com/DHCSSza), by email or on the [DHCSSza Slack Workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/).
