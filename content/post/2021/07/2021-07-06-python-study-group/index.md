[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programming lanuage with many applications in Humanities and Social Sciences. Some examples include Natural Language Processing (NLP), image analysis, data visualisation, various applications of machine learning for example audio analysis and much much more.

In the past few weeks several of our community members indicated an interest to learn Python to solve problems they're grappling with in their work. We heard you, and because there's such a wealth of online resources available to learn Python, we decided the best would be to [start a study group](#get-involved) where we can support and teach you to use those online resources.

The aim of the study group is to provide a regular virtual meeting space where community members can come to learn at their own pace. It's also a great opportunity for more experienced Pythonista to dedicate time to work on their own Python projects or help others hone their programming skills. 

The Python study group was inspired by [Mmasibidi Setaka](https://www.sadilar.org/index.php/en/9-about/65-researcher-sesotho), the Sesotho Researcher at [SADiLaR](https://sadilar.org), who wants to learn Python for work she'll be doing as part of her PhD studies. 

For now we'll be meeting **every second Wednesday at 10:00 - 12:00 SAST** in a Zoom room, with the option of breaking out into smaller groups if people want to learn about, or collaborate on, specific or unique applications of Python in Humanities or Social Sciences. All you have to do is join us and tell us where you are at in your Python journey and what you would like to learn. We'll help you find relevant learning materials or online courses that could get you started and provide support while you're working through these. 

The study group will also use the [DHCSSza Slack Workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) *#learning-python* channel to discuss our ideas, challenges, and successes.

**Next meeting: 21 July @ 10:00 - 12:00 SAST**

The Zoom room will always be open during the alotted time and there is no requirement or committment to join every time. We'll meet you where you are at, and you'll join in when you can.

### Get involved

To get involved or learn more, please join our [DHCSSza Slack workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) and specifically mention that you're interested in Python, or directly join the #learning-python channel.

If you're unfamiliar with Slack, please reach out to us at [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za) to let us know about your interest to participate.

Looking forward to be learning Python with you!
