Like [Python](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-06-python-study-group/), [R is a programming lanuage](https://www.r-project.org/) with many applications in Humanities and Social Sciences. Some examples include statistial analysis, machine learning, text analysis, sentiment analysis, web scraping, data analysis, data visualisation, geocomputation, and much much more.

In the past few days a number of community members expressed an interest to hone their R skills and we decided to team up with the recently founded [Python Study Group](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/2021/07/2021-07-06-python-study-group/) to achieve this goal.

The aim of the study group is to provide a regular virtual meeting space where community members can come to learn at their own pace. It's also a great opportunity for more experienced R users to dedicate time to work on their own R projects or help others hone their programming skills. Since we'll be teaming up with the Python group, there will also be opportunities for cross-collaboration and learning.

We often get questions about Python versus R. Join the study group, meet other users, and get some experience with either or both languages to satisfy your curiosity.

For now we'll be meeting **every second Wednesday at 10:00 - 12:00 SAST** in a Zoom room. There will be two main rooms - one for Python and one for R. We'll also have the option of breaking out into smaller groups if people want to learn about, or collaborate on, specific or unique applications of R in Humanities or Social Sciences. All you have to do is join us and tell us where you are at in your R journey and what you would like to learn. We'll help you find relevant learning materials or online courses that could get you started and provide support while you're working through these. 

As community you are also welcome to give the study group a different flavour or decide to start subgroups at different times that are more suitable. Maybe you'd like to start a *book club* as suggested by Maya Gans in [this short video clip](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/starting-an-r-book-club-cooking-up-friendships-in-isolation/). 

The study group will use the [DHCSSza Slack Workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) *#learning-r* channel to discuss our ideas, challenges, and successes. Also look out for the *#learning-python* and *#learning-programming* channels.

**Next meeting: 21 July @ 10:00 - 12:00 SAST**

The Zoom room will always be open during the alotted time and there is no requirement or committment to join every time. We'll meet you where you are at, and you'll join in when you can.

### Get involved

To get involved or learn more, please join our [DHCSSza Slack workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) and specifically mention that you're interested in R, or directly join the *#learning-r* channel.

If you're unfamiliar with Slack, please reach out to us at [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za) to let us know about your interest to participate.

Looking forward to be learning R with you!
