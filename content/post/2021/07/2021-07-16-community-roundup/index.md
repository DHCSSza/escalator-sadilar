### DHASA Call for papers
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

The [Digital Humanities Association of Southern Africa](https://digitalhumanities.org.za/) (DHASA) is organising its third conference with the theme __“Digitally Human, Artificially Intelligent”__. The field of Digital Humanities is currently still rather underdeveloped in Southern Africa. Hence, this conference has several aims including:
- providing an opportunity for researchers (specifically from Southern Africa) from the broad field of DH to  showcase their research;
- facilitating information sharing and network building to boost collaboration; and
- offering various affiliated workshops and tutorials where researchers can learn about novel technologies and tools.

__Important dates__

- __Submission deadline__: 22 August 2021
- __Date of notification__: 30 September 2021
- __Camera ready copy deadline__: 28 October 2021
- __Conference__: 29 November 2021 – 3 December 2021

### CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Content is available under open licenses and includes lessons about Python, R, SQL, OpenRefine, regular expressions, and more. In South Africa, Carpentries workshops have been run at universities, research councils, and alongside academic conferences since 2014. Thousands of learners have participated in these workshops and learned valuable skills related to data handling, analysis, and visualisation.

CarpentryConnect events offer an opportunity for local communities to network and learn together. The [first South African CarpentryConnect](http://carpentryconnectza.org/) took place in 2018. 

This year, the community is organising the [second South African CarpentryConnect](https://za2021.carpentryconnect.org/) event where participants can attend a variety of workshops, networking events, and the keynote address by Carpentries' Director, Dr. Kari Jordan. Visit the [2021 CarpentryConnect South Africa website](https://za2021.carpentryconnect.org/) for more information and registration links. 


### The Human in Digital Humanities
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

In June, ESCALATOR was represented by Prof Menno van Zaanen at an online symposium titled _The Human in Digital Humanities_. The event was hosted by Tilburg School of Humanities & Digital Sciences at Tilburg University. View the programme, abstracts and speakers at https://www.digitalhumanitiestilburg.com/.


### Apply now for NIHSS SABTT BRICS Research and Teaching Mobility Grants
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

The National Institute for the Humanities and the Social Sciences (NIHSS) and the South African BRICS Think Tank (SABTT) published a call for funding for the  [__2021/22 BRICS Research and Teaching Mobility Grants__](https://www.nihss.ac.za/content/latest/call-funding-202122-digital-brics-research-and-teaching-mobility-grant-humanities-and). The objective of the digital BRICS research and teaching initiative is to provide a platform for researchers and academics to exchange ideas and to generate evidence-based policy recommendations, with the integration of digital and/or hybrid tools, techniques, and platforms into research methodology. Priority will be accorded to the following BRICS thematic areas. For full detail [please visit the NIHSS website](https://www.nihss.ac.za/content/latest/call-funding-202122-digital-brics-research-and-teaching-mobility-grant-humanities-and).

__Call for Funding Submission Deadline: 13 August 2021__


###  Methods Bites - A blog for Computational Social Science techniques
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

> The Social Science Data Lab is an event series at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). It offers a platform for young scholars to present and discuss cutting-edge methods for the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of data in the social sciences.

Methods Bites is the MZES Data and Methods Unit's effort to create a systematic and lasting infrastructure that provides accessible and applied illustrations of the materials covered at their events. Their expanding collection of blog posts makes these materials available to a broader audience and provides a forum for peer discussions and mutual learning. Follow the blog at https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/.

Recent posts cover the following topics:
- [Using Geospatial Data in R](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/geospatial-data/)
- [Generalized Additive Models: Allowing for some wiggle room in your models](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/gam/)
- [Extracting Emotions from Faces with Face++ (and Microsoft Azure)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/extracting-emotions/)

### The challenges and prospects of the intersection of humanities and data science
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

The [Humanities and Data Science Special Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/humanities-and-data-science) based at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) recently produced a white paper titled [_The challenges and prospects of the intersection of humanities and data science_](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/challenges-and-prospects-intersection-humanities-and-data-science4).  The paper offers recommendations for funders, academic institutions, and researchers to support research in this area. It also highlights a series of recommendations for how these two communities can more easily and better work together to realise the full potential of interdisciplinary work. 


### Nature Special Edition - Computational Social Science
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

>The availability of big data has greatly expanded opportunities to study society and human behaviour through the prism of computational analyses. The resulting field is known as computational social science and is defined by its interdisciplinary approaches. However, this type of cross-discipline work is intrinsically challenging, calling for the development of new collaborations and toolkits. In this Nature special collection of articles, we explore some of the fundamental questions and opportunities in computational social science.

### SICSS Festival
*\[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>\]*

In June 2021 the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) hosted a series of online events including tutorials, panel discussions, and debates. The goals of the [SICSS Festival](https://sicss.io/festival) are to provide new learning opportunities for people interested in computational social science, to provide a venue for community building across SICSS partner locations, and to provide an opportunity for SICSS alumni to share their expertise.

Access the full programme along with recordings at https://sicss.io/festival. 

Topics that were covered include:
- [Using images and video data for social science: Challenges and opportunities](https://youtu.be/FBjx7urvuw8)
- [Introduction to Text Analysis in Python: A Hands-on Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ohleQALSrfQ)
- A panel discussion on the non-academic job market in computational social science
