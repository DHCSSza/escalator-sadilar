The launch of the [stakeholder map project](https://escalator.sadilar.org/stakeholder-map/) coincides with the [International Day of DH](https://dhcenternet.org/initiatives/day-of-dh/2022), and includes data on projects, people, publications, datasets, training courses, learning materials, tools, archives, and unclassified records. Information on these record types can now be submitted to the stakeholder map using our [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQ4jwaOWP1KPaxo2Kb6DnrqspUs_68Etuh_dQO_-pgCMtpKg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The stakeholder map data can be visualised via two online interactive platforms, available through the [ESCALATOR website](../../../../stakeholder-map/).

{{< figure src="screenshots.png" caption="The image on the left shows the geolocation of DH/CSS projects in South Africa via a Shiny app. On the right we display a graph network anchored by keywords related to people and institutions. Access the interactive platforms [here](../../../../stakeholder-map/)." numbered="true" >}}

The software and scripts used in developing the data workflow and visualisations are available under open licenses and/or as freeware. Over the next four weeks  we will publish a series of blogs detailing the data pipeline development as part of our committment to open science. The pipeline can be re-used for similar projects in other countries and regions. Read the first blog post for an [introduction to the data pipeline](../intro-stakeholdermap-workflow).

Please visit our [visualisations page]( https://escalator.sadilar.org/stakeholder-map/) or the [detailed description](https://escalator.sadilar.org/stakeholder-map-info/) to interact with the data or learn more.

For inquiries, please reach out to [Dr Anne Treasure](mailto:dhcss-stakeholdermap@talarify.co.za) or share your thoughts via our [Slack workspace](https://escalator.sadilar.org/post/connect-with-the-community/) in the #dhcss-stakeholder-map channel.
