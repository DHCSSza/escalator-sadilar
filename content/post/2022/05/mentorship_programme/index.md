We are excited to announce the publication of our peer-reviewed article *['Ten simple rules for establishing a mentorship programme'](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010015)*.

In the paper, we present a concise summary of recommendations that outline key elements to consider when designing and establishing mentorship programmes. These recommendations are drawn from the collective experiences of 4 different emerging and established mentorship programmes as well as the outcomes of an online mentorship workshop (Indaba) held in April 2021.

The mentorship programmes that contributed to this article include [ESCALATOR Digital
Champions Initiative](https://escalator.sadilar.org/champions/overview),  [Deep Learning Indaba (DLI) Mentorship Programme](https://deeplearningindaba.com/mentorship), Open Education For A Better World ([OE4BW](https://oe4bw.org)), and Open Life Science ([OLS](https://openlifesci.org)).
