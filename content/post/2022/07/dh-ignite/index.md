Participants will include postgraduate students, researchers, lecturers, librarians, archivists, research enablers, and research management. DH-IGNITE will be hosted in six regions in South Africa  between August 2022 - May 2023. The event will introduce concepts related to digital humanities and computational social sciences, showcase opportunities and resources and provide opportunities for participants to connect. Participants can exhibit their work through interactive poster sessions and lightning talks.

DH-IGNITE will also provide universities an opportunity to showcase how they support their faculties in adopting digital and computational methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches in humanities and social sciences research. The event will be offered in hybrid format to allow participants to join in person or virtually. Universities are encouraged to host relevant workshops directly before or after DH-IGNITE to bring more learning and networking opportunities to their institutions.
