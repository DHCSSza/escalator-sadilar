## What can you expect? 

- Meet peers working on digital and computational aspects of humanities and/or social sciences research projects and training; 
- Learn more about humanising data and share your thoughts on the topic; and
- Help to enhance the visibility of South African digital and computational humanities and social sciences research and training. 

The ESCALATOR _Collectathon_ is an opportunity to add information about your work to the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Sciences(CSS) [(DHCSSza) Stakeholder](https://escalator.sadilar.org/stakeholder-map/) map. The stakeholder map provides access to information about people, projects, resources, and training opportunities in the South African DH and CSS landscape. Data is openly accessible and can benefit the community in various ways, including:
- enhancing the visibility of South African research in these areas;
- providing a place to find collaborators, students, or supervisors; and
- providing funders and policymakers with pointers to gaps and opportunities and much more.
