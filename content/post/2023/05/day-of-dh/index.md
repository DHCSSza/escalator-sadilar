[International Day of DH](https://dhcenternet.org/initiatives/day-of-dh), which started in 2009 as “_Day in the Life of Digital Humanities_”, is a day when digital humanists celebrate their work and share it with the broader community. 

[This year's Day of DH](https://crihn.openum.ca/nouvelles/2023/05/02/day-of-dh-2023-is-on-may-31st/) will take place on 31 May worldwide. It is coordinated by the [_Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques_](https://crihn.openum.ca/nouvelles/2023/05/02/day-of-dh-2023-is-on-may-31st/) in Québec, Canada under the theme “__Humanizing Data__”.

> “As the humanities are under pressure internationally, how can DH centres respond to diverse challenges? We are particularly 
> interested in hearing about strategies from the global DH community about their political, financial, or pedagogical challenges 
> and their strategies for overcoming them.”
