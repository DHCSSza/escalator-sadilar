In June, the Escalator team will start offering introductory courses to R and Python for complete novices. _Introduction to Python_ and _Introduction to R_ will be offered as a __four-week course with virtual meetups once weekly for one hour__. The courses will be repeated in June, August, and October 2023. A __maximum of five candidates__ will be accepted into each iteration of the Python and R courses. Potential candidates can apply to participate and will receive a certificate upon completion. 

## ‚Ñπ Course structure

All sessions will be offered through Zoom and are __compulsory__ to attend. Instructors will work through __software installation and the very first steps of using R or Python__ at the hand of open and free training resources that will be shared with participants before the start of the course.

The format will be a __hands-on code-along__, meaning candidates will work on their computers and follow along with the instructor as they work through the material. On alternating Wednesdays, the workshop will be followed by a non-compulsory virtual Python/R study group session where participants will have more time to practice, meet other community members, and ask questions.

The workshop will prepare participants for further self-study, enrolling for other (applied) courses in programming in the language of their choice, benefiting more from the ESCALATOR Python/R study group and more.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Apply to be a facilitator

As we continue to build a community of practice in Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science, we would like to invite proficient programmers in Python and R to apply to be a facilitator.

We will be thrilled to have you aboard as we share knowledge and drive change!

#### Commitments

__Four sessions of 1 hour per week on a Wednesday from 11:00 - 12:00__ per the schedule set out above. We would appreciate it if you could commit to one complete course iteration, as we prefer not to change facilitators halfway through. We will work through one of the open and free online textbooks for learning R and Python (e.g. R for Data Science or Learning Python the Hard Way but open to suggestions).

#### Benefits

As a facilitator, you will receive a __certificate__ of facilitation. We will list you on the ESCALATOR website as a Python/R facilitator and identify additional non-monetary opportunities to reward you for your time.

## ‚ùóStudy group

ESCALATOR has been hosting a bi-weekly virtual Python/R study group for colleagues in Humanities and Social Sciences affiliated with South African universities since 2021. The study group offers an informal environment where students and researchers with a range of programming experience (novice, intermediate and expert) set aside time to learn how to code or work on their programming projects. This is a place where colleagues come to share knowledge and resources, assist each other if help is needed, or work quietly in a break-out room, knowing help is just a ‚Äúchat message or unmute of the microphone‚Äù away.
