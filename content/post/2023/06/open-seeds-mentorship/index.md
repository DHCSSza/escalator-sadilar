## About Open Seeds
---
_[[back to top]](#)_

Open Seeds is a 16-week long __mentorship and cohort-based training__, where participants (organisers, hosts, mentors and project leads/mentees) share their expertise and gain knowledge essential for running open science projects, connect with members across communities, backgrounds, and identities, and empower each other to become effective open science ambassadors in their communities. 

Participants join this program __individually or in teams__, with  projects they either are already working on or want to start developing during the program. 

The goals, learning objectives, timelines, and schedules can be found on OLSâ€™s website: https://openlifesci.org/ols-8. 

The training programme consists of __bi-weekly training sessions__ where presenters share best practices in contemporary and open research. Topics include for example, tooling and roadmapping for open projects, project management, agile methodologies, design for inclusivity, and more. Various __skill-up sessions__ are also included in different time slots. These include for example, Github for beginners, open source software, and open leadership.

Each project is __matched to a suitable international mentor__ with whom members meet bi-weekly to discuss their projects and progress. Mentors are recruited from a broad range of research disciplines and have expertise in open science and the use of various tools and methodologies for collaboration and contemporary research.

## What is unique in Cohort 8?

_[[back to top]](#)_

For the next cohort intake (OLS-8) __ESCALATOR will provide additional contextualised support__ to a maximum of three project teams from South Africa who qualify according to the Open Seeds eligibility criteria and aligns broadly with the ESCALATOR focus area.

It may include up to __four in-person meetings with local mentors__, participation in the [DH-IGNITE conferences](https://dh-ignite.org),  additional support through the dedicated Slack workspace for the ESCALATOR community and other opportunities to network within the local and global research community.
