{{< spoiler text="__:books: Can you describe your background and your current role?__" >}}

#### What line of work are you in?
I work in the IT sector where I train machine learning models and make them explainable.

#### Give a short summary of what you do in this role
As a data scientist, I work with
different types of data (both structured and unstructured) to build products that
help automate tasks and support people in their daily lives. I enjoy the variety
that comes with the job because no two questions are the same and you always
have to be creative with the solutions you come up with.

#### What did you study?

I studied political science with a focus on conflict studies
and statistics.

#### How did you get involved in the tech space?

By developing my first open-source
software and getting involved in the communities (mainly R-Ladies and
PyLadies). It showed me that building tools that can help people in their lives is
what I love to do.

#### What software do you use on a daily basis in your job?

I mainly use Python for
programming these days, but have also worked as a data scientist and data
engineer using R (and SQL, of course). Depending on the requirements, I
develop things in the cloud (mainly AWS or Google Cloud Platforms) or locally.

#### How did you learn to use these tools?

By doing. I start by reading about the
basics to get some theoretical understanding, but I learn best by doing.
Developing my first R package, for example, taught me so much that I could
never have learned just from a textbook. It always helps to have a reliable
resource to look things up, but since the challenges are always different, it's the
practice that teaches me the most.

#### Which tool has the biggest impact on your ability to succeed at work?

I think it's
a combination of curiosity, creativity and persistence. Some problems seem
unsolvable at first, but if you're persistent (and have a great team to discuss
things with), you'll eventually come up with a creative solution üòä.

#### Do you think women are well represented in your line of work?

Tech has traditionally been a male-dominated industry. And while I'd definitely like to see
more diversity, I'm convinced that we're on the right track to making it a good
place for everyone üòä

{{< spoiler text="__üå± Tell us more about your community of practice__" >}}

#### Describe the purpose of this community from your point of view.

R-Ladies is an
empowering community that aims to promote gender diversity in the R
community worldwide. Whether it's a virtual or in-person meetup, an inspiring
discussion in our Slack workspace, or meeting other R-Ladies at a conference -
it's all about coming together, learning, and having fun üòä

#### How did you get involved?

I discovered R-Ladies in 2020 when all the events
were online and R-Ladies Bergen was hosting an event about building a
website. I thought "hey, that sounds interesting" and signed up. Julia, one of the
organizers of R-Ladies Bergen, contacted me and asked if I would like to present
at one of their upcoming meetings and although I was hesitant at first, I agreed
and gave a workshop on using NLP models. The supportive atmosphere I
experienced encouraged me to start a local chapter, R-Ladies Cologne, because
I wanted to give back to the community what I had experienced üòä


#### Why do you find it useful to be a part of this community?

It's the supportive
atmosphere that I really enjoy - and this really is the place where you can ask
any question. Everyone has been a beginner and the people in the community
are happy to help and let you learn!

#### Is your community accessible and welcoming to women? If so, how?

A definite
yes! R-Ladies' core vision is to empower gender diversity (not just women, but
all gender minorities) and we are constantly working to improve things to
become more accessible.

#### How can other people become a part of this community?

It's easy ‚Äì reach out,
join our Slack workspace, the directory (a list that showcases R-Ladies‚Äô profiles),
or one of our meetings! https://rladies.org/about-us/involved/

#### What other communities of practice are you a part of?

PyLadies, Google's
Women Techmakers Ambassadors, and CorrelAid (a nonprofit data for good
organization)

{{< spoiler text="__:bulb: What advice do you have for women in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) eager to grow their computational skills?__" >}}

It's an old one, but "stay curious". The best ideas
come from thinking outside the box and borrowing from other disciplines.
