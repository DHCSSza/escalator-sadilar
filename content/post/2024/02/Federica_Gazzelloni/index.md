{{< spoiler text="__:film_projector: What is your all time favourite movie and what makes it so special?__" >}}

My all-time favorite movie is "Notting Hill." I love it because it's a
heartwarming romantic comedy with charming characters and funny dialogues that
never fails to lift my spirits.

{{< spoiler text="__:books: Can you describe your background and your current role?__" >}}

As for my background and current role, I am a statistician and actuary with a
deep passion for data science and technology. I work as an independent
researcher.

#### What line of work are you in?
Data Science

#### Give a short summary of what you do in this role
In my current role, as an independent researcher, I focus on advanced
statistical methods for data modeling, particularly in the field of public
health. I am also actively involved in the tech space, collaborating with
organizations like R4DS and RLadies to promote gender diversity and
knowledge-sharing within the R programming community.

#### What did you study?

Statistics and Actuarial Science

#### How did you get involved in the tech space?

My involvement in the tech space began during the pandemic when I
decided to transition from using Excel to learning R programming.

#### What software do you use on a daily basis in your job?

R

#### How did you learn to use these tools?

I have improved my skills in R and other tools such as Python and SQL
through self-learning and participation in online courses and community
events.

#### Which tool has the biggest impact on your ability to succeed at work?

R

#### Do you think women are well represented in your line of work?

I am not sure about that. Mostly men are in the actuarial position around
the world but there are some women as well. In the field of Data Science
there are a lot of open source communities that make friendly space for
women to share their abilities.

{{< spoiler text="__:bulb: What advice do you have for women in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) eager to grow their computational skills?__" >}}

For women in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) eager to grow their
computational skills, my advice would be to start by learning the basics of
programming and data analysis using resources like online courses, tutorials,
and community events. Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek out mentorship,
and collaborate with others in the field. And most importantly, don't
underestimate the value of practice and persistence in building your skills and
confidence in the tech space.
