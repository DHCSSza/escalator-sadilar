{{< spoiler text="__:film_projector: What is your all time favourite movie and what makes it so special?__" >}}

Kingsman: The Secret Service, starring Colin Firth as Harry Hart  and Taron Egerton as ‚Äú Eggsy" it is a very classy movie about secret agents. My take away from it is how a Harry Hart leads Eggsy to be a gentleman, take responsibility, and also build a career.

#### What line of work are you in?

I am a Digital Humanities Researcher focusing on Sesotho at the South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR). 

#### Give a short summary of what you do in this role

 I do  research in Sesotho combined with digital methodologies. I host workshops to teach academics digital methodologies, I write and publish research, I write project proposals, I am involved in organising conferences and workshops such as DHASA and RAIL. I recently did the Language resources Audit at all the 26 universities in the country.

 BA African Languages and Media Studies, BA Hons Applied Languages, MA African Languages: Corpus-based study for Sesotho


#### How did you get involved in the tech space?

 SADiLaR introduced me to the tech space. 


#### What software do you use on a daily basis in your job?

I am currently learning python so that I can apply it to my phd studies. I use different tools depending on the problems I am solving.

#### How did you learn to use these tools?

I attend the python basics class offered by ESCALATOR

Python


#### Do you think women are well represented in your line of work?

{{< spoiler text="__üå± Tell us more about your community of practice__" >}}

#### Describe the purpose of this community from your point of view.

I belong to a number of communities in the tech space and this gives me an opportunity to learn and know that I have help at my fingertips when I need it. 


#### How did you get involved?

 It was more on interest. I looked at how the communities of practice can assist me and word of mouth as well. When we network we meet people with different skills and knowledge and learn a lot through these interactions

#### Why do you find it useful to be a part of this community?

There is always someone to help. 

#### Is your community accessible and welcoming to women? If so, how?

As an example, I am part of OLS, and most of the coordinators of OLS are women who are always willing to help and understand us.

#### How can other people become a part of this community?

 I applied to be a part of the OLS open seeds program and got accepted. However, there are other communities of practice like ESCALATOR, where you do not apply.
