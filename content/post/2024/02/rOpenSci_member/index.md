Frozen. Elsa‚Äôs story relates so much to me. I struggled to find self-empowerment and
overcome trauma which was not easy but led to a life of isolation. I overcome this pain
through self-discovery, hope, knowing and appreciating my loved ones.

{{< spoiler text="__:books: Can you describe your background and your current role?__" >}}

* What line of work are you in?
* Give a short summary of what you do in this role
* What did you study?
* How did you get involved in the tech space?
* What software do you use on a daily basis in your job?
* How did you learn to use these tools?
* Which tool has the biggest impact on your ability to succeed at work?
* Do you think women are well represented in your line of work?

I am a data scientist and I got into tech after graduating with a B.Sc. in Industrial Chemistry. My
university experience didn‚Äôt give me much motivation to continue in the field of chemistry
which I love so much. I started as a web developer, and then a software developer before
taking a long break to care for my family.
I got back to working independently as a business analyst having taking some courses while
on my long break. I got the spark to go into data science while working on a data science and
analytics-related project as a business analyst. I was curious and fascinated with what had
been achieved with data and that was it. I slowly developed my skills in data science by taking
online courses using Python and R programming languages with a preference for R. R was
easy to learn and the community was very open and friendly. I also got into building learning
communities to get support from professionals, and also giving back to the community by
volunteering my time to teach and mentor.
Along the way, I have also had opportunities to contribute to open-source projects like the
rOpensci Champions program.

Although the numbers might be low, concerning women&#39;s representation. For me, women‚Äôs
representation does not determine their strength. The women I had the opportunity of meeting
have had more lasting impact on my life and my journey in the data science field

{{< spoiler text="__üå± Tell us more about your community of practice__" >}}

* Describe the purpose of this community from your point of view.
* How did you get involved?
* Why do you find it useful to be a part of this community?
* Is your community accessible and welcoming to women? If so, how?
* How can other people become a part of this community?
* What other communities of practice are you a part of?

Our communities, Abuja R User group and R-Ladies Abuja were founded to enable individuals
struggling to get their feet stable in technology - data science, and analytics using open source
programming languages especially R through support from individuals from the academic and
industry sector as they grow on their journey to professionalism.
Creating the groups for me has served as the perfect haven to grow for me starting my journey
into data science using R. I got the opportunity to learn, teach, mentor, and network. So, many
of our members have achieved success within these communities.
I am also a champion within the rOpenSci, a community for R users and package developers as
well as a member of the R-Ladies Global community which provides an enabling community
for women and minority groups.

{{< spoiler text="__:bulb: What advice do you have for women in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) eager to grow their computational skills?__" >}}

My advice would be ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be hard on yourself, believe in yourself, believe in your
journey and your chosen path, and always belong to a community and get support
when you need it."

Remember, ‚ÄúUbuntu is about a community coming together to help one another.‚Äù
