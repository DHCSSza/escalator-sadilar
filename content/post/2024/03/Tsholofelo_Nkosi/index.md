{{< spoiler text="__:bulb: What advice do you have for women in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) eager to grow their computational skills?__" >}}

 Pick up one core tech language, learn the fundamentals, everything else will fall into place and also don't be discouraged by how people say it's difficult. You can certainly do anything you put your mind into.
