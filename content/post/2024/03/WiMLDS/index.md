#### Can you provide a brief overview of the community's mission?

We started the Accra Ghana community in August of 2020

#### Which region(s) are you active in?

The entire organization can be found all over the world. However the chapter in Ghana is currently active only in Accra. Most of our meetups are done virtually so we are able to have people all over Ghana join in.

We connect on Zoom at least once every month through a meetup on a related data science of machine learning topic.

{{< spoiler text="__🌍 Can you share some thoughts on DEI in your community__" >}}

#### Could you share some of the key initiatives or programs the community has implemented to promote diversity and inclusion within the field?

* We acknowledge that there are very great women in the field of data science and machine learning. As  such, we make it a point that our invited speakers 90% of the time are women or from under-represented groups.

* This year, we are beginning our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7163592404283965440"> Women Crush Wednesday series</a>, in which we aim to highlight women doing amazing work in the field.

* Our community is also open to anyone who identifies as par of an underrepresented group.



#### Can you share any of the success stories or milestones the community has achieved in terms of DEI?

* **Increased Representation:** We have successfully increased the representation of underrepresented groups within our community through  outreach programs, and partnerships with diverse organizations eg Deep Learning Indaba, AIMS Ghana

* **Empowering Marginalized Voices:** through our monthly meetups, Twitter spaces etc we have created a safe place for marginalized voices to be heard and amplified.

* **Accessible Resources:** We have recordings of our sessions on YouTube which are accessible to both members and non-members of the WiMLDS Accra. Materials from our monthly meetups are shared with participants while we write blogs on past sessions for other people to read.

* **Celebrating Diversity:** We regularly celebrate the diversity of our community through events, initiatives, and recognition programs that highlight the contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This helps to create a culture of appreciation and respect for diversity.


#### What advice would you give to other communities wanting to create inclusive and welcoming spaces?

In building an inclusive community, it is important that all members have an equal representation to voice their opinions. Discourage any community member who consistently tries to suppress/silence and make others feel uncomfortable. Inclusive communities can only grow when everyone involved feels represented, heard and valued.

{{< spoiler text="__🌟 Final words of encouragement__" >}}

#### Why would you encourage people to join communities of practice?

Communities give you a safe place to be yourself and grow. Most of the time, you will find people with similar interests and backgrounds as yourself. You will get the opportunity to learn from their stories and experiences to grow in your field.


#### Give a word of advice for individuals who are not yet involved in a community of practice. 

Communities are an integral part of our journey, join one today.
