In recent years, Slack has become an increasingly popular online platform for academic communities to grow collaboration and share knowledge and resources. Slack is an online workspace where various channels can be created to offer a space where community members can discuss specific topics.

The [Digital Humanities Slack workspace](http://tinyurl.com/DHslack) was created in 2015. The workspace currently has almost 2000 members from around the globe. The workspace hosts a set of informal, connected chat rooms for the digital humanities and related interests, with over 70 "channels" (chat rooms) devoted to specific topics such as DH teaching, coding, library work, and conferences.

In February 2021, a new channel for African collaboration, *#dh_africa*, was added to the global DH workspace by Prof Menno van Zaanen from SADiLaR. This channel will provide a space for community members based in Africa to connect and share opportunities, experiences, and resources.

If you'd like to learn more about the DH Slack workspace, please read this [detailed post by Dr Amanda Visconti](http://literaturegeek.com/2016/07/06/digital-humanities-slack-community-design). According to her the workspace is 

> "...open to anyone with a curiosity about DH and/or related interests (e.g. digital libraries, museums, and archives). 
> Absolutely no expertise needed, and we have several specific chat rooms (called “channels” on Slack) devoted to DH 
> beginners, students, job seekers, and asking all kinds of DHy and digital methods questions."
