If you are planning an event related to computational or digital practices, resources, methodologies, or communities related to Humanities and Social Sciences we'll gladly advertise it on our website and through our social media platforms.

A [list of events](../../activities) is available on the ESCALATOR website. The list can be filtered based on event category. Our website is also fully searchable. With this resource we're hoping to create greater awareness of opportunities available to researchers and students in South Africa and grow the local community of practice.

To add your event to this database, please complete the form available at [https://forms.gle/1K2PhsqZQnScEn548](https://forms.gle/1K2PhsqZQnScEn548) or email [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za).

If you have any questions or suggestions about this resource, please reach out to us at [escalator@talarify.co.za](mailto:escalator@talarify.co.za).

We look forward to growing the community together by sharing knowledge of resources and opportunities!
