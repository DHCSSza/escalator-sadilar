title: "Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS)"
summary: "The Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) were created to provide free training to the next generation of researchers at the intersection of social science and data scienceâ€” and to incubate cutting-edge research across disciplinary boundaries. We provide state-of-the art training in a range of different areas in computational social science from ethics to text analysis and mass collaboration. These lectures assume a basic, working knowledge of the R language."
